                <h1>History of p.js</h1>
                <p>
                    My original college major was mechanical engineering. While interesting and enjoyable, I took a
                    programming course and was fascinated. I knew early on I had to switch majors. My first job was
                    mostly Java. I saw a colleague filling in a form,{' '}
                    <em>and the rest of the screen updated, like magic</em>. It was AngularJS, and just as I knew I
                    needed to leave mechanical engineering for software, I had to leave Java for JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colleagues took notice of my passion for JavaScript and my growing contributions to various
                    projects. One of them noticed my full name and mused "
                    <em>P... JS. You were meant to write JavaScript.</em>" And so I did.

                        I prefer to use <b>TailwindCSS</b>

                        Backend: I use <b>nodejs</b> and <b>express</b> these days, but I was Java/Spring for several
                        years (not anymore!)

                    <li>
                        Persistence: I am more familiar with relational databases such as <b>PostgreSQL</b> than NoSQL
                        ones, but I can get around in <b>MongoDB</b>
